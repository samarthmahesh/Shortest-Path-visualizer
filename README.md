# Shortest-Path- Visualizer
Project done on Nov 10th 2024. 
A Python project that implements NetworkX and Matplotlib together with Dijkstra’s algorithm to identify and display the minimal distance path between weighted graph network cities.

PROJECT

SHORTEST DISTANCE BETWEEN 2 CITIES IN A NETWORK


OBJECTIVE:

We aim to create a five-city network connecting cities through measured distances which we will represent using weighted GRAPHS.

After building the city network we will determine the shortest path between two cities through DIJKSTRA’S algorithm.

TOOLS USED:

  NetworkX functions as the primary tool for graph creation and modification of city networks through node-based city representation and weighted edge distances.

  Matplotlib functions as the visualization tool that represents graphs by drawing nodes and edges while displaying the shortest path.

  Heapq functions as the Python standard library module to implement a priority queue which optimizes Dijkstra’s algorithm through efficient minimum distance retrieval.
